# About
This project extracts video game sales data from VGChartz using web scraping, followed by data cleaning with Pandas. It then visualizes the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate insightful charts and plots, providing a comprehensive overview of trends in the video game industry.

# Limitations
The dataset contains a significant amount of missing data, with sales information available for only 19,000 out of 66,000 rows. As a result, the analysis is inherently constrained by the completeness and quality of the available data.

# Visualizations
Given the incomplete nature of the dataset, the following visualizations have been generated to offer potential insights.
